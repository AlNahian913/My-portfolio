            <h3>Biriyani is Love</h3>
            <p>The answer lies in part with the nature of the dish: biryani is fragrant, spiced rice that has been
                parboiled
                and
                then cooked with meat, usually chicken or goat. ... Biryani contains pricey saffron; the higher the
                quality
                of
                the saffron used, the better the biryani turns out.</p>

            <h3>Burger is Emotion</h3>
            <p>The first and most obvious answer to the question of why we're so obsessed with burgers is: burgers are
                cheap.
                ... It's not just that burgers are cheap, it's that they're easy to eat. Because the meat is ground up,
                you
                don't have to do much chewing. Because it's served on a bun, it's easy to eat.</p>

            <h3>Street Fuckha</h3>
            <p>Fuckha consists of a series of small crispy dough shells, topped with chickpeas and potato stew along
                with
                other garnishes, including green onions, chili peppers and cilantro. Another key aspect is that it is
                then
                topped with (or dipped in) a light tamarind water. The fuchka was a delicious mix of complex flavors,
                and
                the crispy shells perfectly complemented the soft chickpeas and potatoes.</p>
